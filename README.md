# minify-j-s package

A very comfortable GUI wrapper for UglifyJS for atom text editor.

## Features

* Minify an entire directory
* "plug and play" (nothing to config, no tmp files)

## Install
Install via apm:
> $ apm install minify-j-s

via atom GUI:
Just go to settings (ctrl+,) and then to packages or install
and then install the package and enjoy. (it should be enabled by default)

## Usage
Ctrl + Alt + Shift + M

Escape to cancel.
Enter to proceed.

*NOTE:* if your output js is in the directory, for now it will feed into itself. (this allows appending of old and new)

## License
I want to make it clear that I'm using UglifyJS:

So it's BSD License also applies to this.
Additional to that the software itself MIT licensed, for more info check LICENSE.md
